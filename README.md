Redis Sentinel
---
Redis Sentinel provides high availability for Redis. In practical terms this means that using Sentinel you can create a Redis deployment that resists without human intervention to certain kind of failures.
Additionally also provides other collateral tasks such as monitoring, notifications and acts as a configuration provider for clients.
